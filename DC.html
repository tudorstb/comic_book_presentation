&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initials "DC" came from the company's popular series Detective Comics,
 which featured Batman's debut and subsequently became part of the company's
 name. Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC Comics offices have 
 been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909 Third Avenue; 75 Rockefeller
 Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its headquarters at 
 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, but it was announced in October 2013
 that DC Entertainment would relocate its headquarters from New York to Burbank, California in April 2015.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Random House distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market, while Diamond Comic Distributors supplies the comics shop specialty market.
 DC Comics and its longtime major competitor Marvel Comics (acquired in 2009 by The Walt Disney Company, Time Warner's main competitor) together
 shared approximately 70% of the American comic book market in 2017.<dl>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneur Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson founded National Allied Publications in autumn 1934.
 The company debuted with the tabloid-sized New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1 with a cover date of February 
 1935. The company's second title, New Comics #1 (Dec. 1935), appeared in a size close to what would become comic
 books' standard during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, with slightly larger dimensions than today's.
 That title evolved into Adventure Comics, which continued through issue #503 in 1983, becoming one of the longest-running comic-book series.
 In 2009 DC revived Adventure Comics with its original numbering. In 1935,Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the future creators of Superman,
 created Doctor Occult, who is the earliest DC Comics character to still be in the DC Universe.
 <dl>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheeler-Nicholson's third and final title, Detective Comics, advertised with a cover illustration dated December 1936, eventually premiered 
three months late with a March 1937 cover date. The themed anthology series would become a sensation with the introduction of Batman in issue
 #27 (May 1939). By then, however, Wheeler-Nicholson had gone. In 1937, in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor Harry Donenfeld
 —who also published pulp magazines and operated as a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News—Wheeler-Nicholson had to take Donenfeld 
 on as a partner in order to publish Detective Comics #1. Detective Comics, Inc. was formed, with Wheeler-Nicholson and Jack S. Liebowitz, Donenfeld's
 accountant, listed as owners. Major Wheeler-Nicholson remained for a year, but cash-flow problems continued, and he was forced out. Shortly afterward,
 Detective Comics, Inc. purchased the remains of National Allied, also known as Nicholson Publishing,at a bankruptcy auction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective Comics, Inc. soon launched a fourth title, Action Comics, the premiere of which introduced Superman. Action Comics #1 (June 1938),
the first comic book to feature the new character archetype—soon known as "superheroes"—proved a sales hit. The company quickly introduced such other
 popular characters as the Sandman and Batman.
<dl>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 22, 2010,a copy of Action Comics #1 (June 1938) sold at an auction from an anonymous seller to an anonymous buyer for $1 million, besting 
the $317,000 record for a comic book set by a different copy, in lesser condition, the previous year.</p>
